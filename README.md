# My Manager

My Manager “Small Scale Business Management System” is a platform which provides its customers to easily manage their business tasks. The whole system is encompassed by 5 services. Which are,
- eProduct
- eStock
- eDelivery
- eEmployee
- ePOS

These functions provide the small-scale business owner to manage and analyse his/her products, stock, deliveries, and also to keep track of the employee count, salary, and number of leaves taken by them .

## Tech

My Manager uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Angular] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Spring] - an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform.
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Core UI] -  an open source Bootstrap 4 & Angular based admin template.


And of course My Manager itself is open source with a [public repository][mymgr]
 on GitHub.
